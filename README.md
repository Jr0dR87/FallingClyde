Falling Clyde is a game I developed in 2014 and has gone through massive changes.

I'm currently happy with its current build and I'm sharing my source code for those interested
in how the game works or if someone wants to use the code to build their own game. 

The game is built off an HTML5 Game Engine called [ImpactJS](https://github.com/phoboslab/impact). Back in 2014, the engine cost $99 dollars 
and I didn't want to include it in any repo. The engine has became free to download along with other examples.

If you are interested in learning more about ImpactJS, Jesse Freeman wrote a great book called 
HTML5 Games with ImpactJS

Enjoy!
