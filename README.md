Falling Clyde is a game I developed in 2014 and has gone through massive changes.

I'm currently happy with its current build and I'm sharing my source code with those interested
in how the game works or if someone wants to use the code to build their own game. 

The game is built off an HTML5 Game Engine called [ImpactJS](https://github.com/phoboslab/impact). Back in 2014, the engine cost $99 dollars 
and I didn't want to include it in my git repo. The engine has become free to download along with other examples. That's why I have now included it, so anyone can download my game and in just a few steps, have it up and running to play with.

If you are interested in learning more about ImpactJS, Jesse Freeman wrote a great book called 
HTML5 Games with ImpactJS.
